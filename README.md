# Senko's PvP Helper for Elden Ring

This is a tool to give a better experience in pvp in [seamless co-op](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510)! It also helps with making future pvp builds! If you would like to use the helper offline without seamless co-op, I recommend using [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/90).

### Please note that this is meant for seamless co-op and not the base game! Using this tool in the base game will likely get you banned. I am not responsible if you get banned using this tool.
